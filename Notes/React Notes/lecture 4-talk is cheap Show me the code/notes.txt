** First make blueprint of your project,Decide how your app is goint to look on UI

** Prop property to pass data, passing prop to component is like passing an argument to function 

** React will wrap all properties in props that is an object and pass it in function, 
   we can also restructure props while passing in function 
=> example const (resName, resimage, Cusine)= props:

** Config driven Ul config comes from backend, The configuration settings for the Ul are typically stored in 
   configuration files or databases, which are read by the application during runtime

** Optional chaining --It is a feature that allows you to safely access properties or call methods on 
                       nested objects or arrays without worrying about null or undefined values

** Whenever mapping or looping on anything always give a key(id) to it as every child should be uniquely represented, 
   if key not given & any new element come so react would have to re-render all becoz it would not know where 
   the new element is added but if id is given it would rerender only the element with the new id

React says never use index as keys, its a bad practise
