useEffect() -- Deep Knowledge
        {
                useEffect is a function which take to aruguments in it first one is a callback function and second one is dependecy array
                and it get called after the component renderd succesfully  
            
            {
               Q1 when does useEffect get called
               A.  if no dependecny array is present in useEffect function called everytime a component render useEffect get called. 

                   if Empty dependency array is empty and present in useeffect it get called only one time while initialisation

                   if dependency array has a name of any component it get called after everytime the component renders (for ex if we change 
                   anything in any component it renders everytime if put that component in that array the useEffect will be called every time
                    the component get renderd ) 
            }
        }

**React RouterDom -- it a library

**React Router -- it helps to go to the different page of website without leaving that page.just like youtube

                  imagine you have a toy with different rooms, like a doll's house. Each room has its own special things inside.
                  Now, imagine you want to play in different rooms without leaving the house and going outside.

                 React Router is like magic for your toy house. It helps you move from one room to another without going outside. 
                 So, you can go from the kitchen to the bedroom, and then to the living room, all without going out of your house. 
                 It's like having secret doors inside your house that take you to different places.

                 In the same way, when we build websites or apps, we want people to be able to go to different parts without 
                 leaving the whole page. React Router is like those secret doors that help us go to different parts of the app 
                 without needing to reload the whole page. It makes everything feel smooth and fun, just like playing with your 
                 toy house!

** Configuration : some information that will define what will happen on any specific route

whenever we have to route we have to use routing configuration--
    -for that we have to import something knownn as createBrowserRouter from react-router-dom library
     createBrowserRouter - it will create routing configuration for us it takes a list of path in it
     how does it do so let me show
     const appRoute  = createBrowserRouter([   ----hare it tkaes the list of path
        {
            path:"/"                                 ---- if path is  / 
            element: <AppLayout/ >                   ---- load this element(in element AppLayoutmeant home page component)
        }
        {
            path:"/about"                             ---- if path is  /about
            element:<about />                         ---- load this element(in element <about/> means about page component)
        }
     ])

     Router provider: it is a component provides the routing configuration to app
     Imported as named import- import {createBrowserRouter , routerProvider} from react-router-dom 

** use "rafce" commant to generate component aotomatically

** If we give some route that is not defined then react router Dom will automatically gives you the page of 404 not found, 
   not the ugly looking error 

** "UseRouteError" is a hook given to us by react router dom, this hooks gives you more information about the error

** Outlet it is a component provided by reactRouterDom to replace the children mentioned in createBrowserRouter
   in with outlet component. An <Outlet should be used in parent route elements to render their child route elements 

** In react to go on another page never use a anchor tag becuase the whole page will be loaded (rendered) again if the <a> tag is used

** We can navigate to a new page, without reloading the whole page and by only changing the body via link

** link is a super power which is given by react router dom to navigate to a new page without re-rendering new page 
    how to use - 1. it is imported as named import from react router dom
                 2. used like this <li><Link to= "/">Home</Link></li>

** there are are two types of routing in web
    1. Server side routing: like on html page makes a request and server sends the page. 
    2. Client side routing is we don't need to make a call pages is switching on client side only


** Make Path Dynamic - it means that making the path dynamic for uniqueness for-ex(every restaurant have differnt menu so we can 
                       identify that restaurant by unique ID by making ID dynamic we can make menu differnt for every restaurant)

                        {
                            path:"/restaurant/:id"                        ---- By adding : we can make our ID dynamic and changeable according to request made 
                            element: <RestaurantMenu/ >                   ---- load this element(in element menu page of restaurant page component)
                        }

** useParams - it is hook given by react router dom  which takes the id or whatever we give in path it store the value in it

                const {id} = useParams()    ------here useParams takes out the id and we use {} for destructuring the object


** when we use <Link></Link> in jsx it shows anchor tag (<a href=""/>) in dom howis it happening is behind the scene link is using anchor tag
