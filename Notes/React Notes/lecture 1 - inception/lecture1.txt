Q-> what is react?
A   -> React is a javascript library for building user interphase.
    -> react is used to build single page applications.
    -> React allows us to create reusable UI component.
--we use script tag for using javascript in HTML
--in script tag we use document.createElement("h1") to create any element like h1,p,article
  and give that element a name by using const 'const heading =document.createElement("h1")'
--after doing this we use inner.HTML to print 'heading.innerHTML = "HELLO WORLD WRITTEN IN JAVASCRIPT"'

**Browser's Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure and content
  of a web page as a tree-like structure. It provides a way for programs, such as web browsers or JavaScript
  to interact with and manipulate the elements and content of a web page.



*  There are two things IN React=>
    1. React -> It is the code which is written by Facebook coders And we use that code to build React web.
    2. React Dom -> It is Document Object Model which allows coder to update pre written code by that
       without touching old code.  

*  Like In Javascriptwe use documnet.createElement()  but in React we use react.createElement()
   and we have to pass 3 parametre in it (tag(h1,p),Object{},Html you want  to write in it"Hello this is html")
   it is a core thing to create element in React it comes from react library

*  But React dom is another library and when we create root and render something inside it we use ReactDOM.createRoot()
   we created root bu doing this for our library and after that we will pass document.getElementByID() 
   in ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementByID())

* When we use .render it replaces the code which was written earlier
