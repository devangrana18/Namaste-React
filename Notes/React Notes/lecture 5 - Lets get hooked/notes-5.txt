the good practice is to make saperate file for saperate component.

there are 2 types of exports - named export and default export 
  
   Default Export--when We need to exprt only one component then
                    we use export default name of component

                    when we import them we write normally -- import name from"file name"


    Named Export  --When we need to export more than one component then we use
                    named export by writing export before intializing component 

                    when we import them we  use {} while writing name -- import {name} from "file name"
                     


React hooks -- normal javascript function writen by facebook developers 
               Which have some utility in it wich comes withe grreat superpowers and it is written in react which we import

               it have multiple hooks in react but 2 of them are very mainly uses
               useState() and useEffect()

useState() --  it is a hook which is mainly used to update UI accordingly

               for example we want restaurant more than 4 star rating so we can do filter that normal list to filtered list 
               but how can we update that list so here usestate comes in power by using useState we can update that list 
               
               const [filteredlist(param1) , changed list(param2)] = useState(the original list)

               it takes 2 param first one can be anything object,integer etc but 2nd param will always be a function to set new value

               here original list is made equal to filteredlist before filtering using use state

               Wheneer state variable changes react rerender the component 

               we use it by importing it as named import from react
               import (useState) from "react"
               how we use it-
               it is a local state variable which have its memory in local scope 

Reconciliation algorithm (React fiber) --  in 2016 a new algorithm come into market
                                            react fiber is the new way of finding the difference and updating Dom 

                                            whenever something changes on UI this is called Reconciliation


Diff algorithm -- it find out the differnce between old virtualdom and new virtual dom when clicked and update the UI

virtual Dom-- it is representation of actual Dom

whay react is fast ?
    because React do efficient Dom manipulation
