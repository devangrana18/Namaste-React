What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and as export?

   Default Export--when We need to exprt only one component then
                    we use export default name of component

                    when we import them we write normally -- import name from"file name"

    Named Export  --When we need to export more than one component then we use
                    named export by writing export before intializing component 

                    when we import them we  use {} while writing name -- import {name} from "file name"
