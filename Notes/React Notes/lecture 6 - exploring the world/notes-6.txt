THER ARE TWO TYE OF APPROACH TO LOAD UI
    1 - first load then call API and after that render that But it took too much time to render that

    2 - first load then render the page and then Call API and then re-render the page 
        
**useEffect Hook -- it also come from react library and imported as named import
                    use effect is normal function which takes 2 Aruguments 1st callback Function,2nd-Dependency array
                    useEffect(()=>{},[]) 
                    this useEffect callback function will ebee called after component render 
                    for example--when we load any Page it show us shimmer Ui which means rendering is been done 
                    and now you see the actual data which means use effect's callback function exectued 

**CORS POLICY -- Our browser block to call API from one origin to another origin
                 Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

**Optional chaining is a feature that allows you to safely access properties or call methods on nested objects or arrays 
  without worrying about null or undefined values

**Shimmer UI -- it is type of a fake skelaton which appears on UI till the API bring data from DB 

**Conditional rendering -- rendering according to condition like if no data is rendering yet 
                           we can use shimmer Ul till there is no data rendered it i.e called conditional rendering like
                           for condition with no data rendered yet
