React Component

 Every thing in react is a component 

there are two types of component in React-
1-- Class based componnent  - old 
2-- functional based component - New/latest 

**React functional component--It is just a normal javascript function which returns some piece of jsx element
                               We can also say that A Javascript function which returns react element
Whenever we use react Functional component we should start from  capital letter otherwise we will get Error

const Heading = () =>(
   return <h1>Namaste react functional componentt</h1>
)

when we render any element we used 
const Root = ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementByID("root"))
    Root.render(element name)



If we are rendering Functional component we will use (<component's Name/>)

const Root = ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementByID("root"))
    Root.render(<component Name/>)


when Bable see  </> in  Root.render(<component Name/>)  this it it automatically understand that it is funcional component  


**component composition --Using one component into another component is known as component composition.
  example --
   const Heading2= () =>(
   return (
    <Heading/>
    <h1>Namaste react functional componentt</h1>
    )
    )
   In above Example I use heading Componentin Heading2 Component now browser will print "Namaste react functional componentt"
    and the thing which is in Heading
 

 whenever we want to write Javascript in jsx  we use {}
 just like we want to add any element in our component so we will use {}and write it name in between

 for example--
 const Number = 1000
 
 const Heading2= () =>(
   return (
    {Number} -------------------you can do any thing in this curly paranthesis just like
    <h3>{Number+2}</h3>----------we can write js in between tags
    {Heading()}------------------we can call a component also in these paranthesis
    {etc}
    <h1>Namaste react functional componentt</h1>
    )
)
