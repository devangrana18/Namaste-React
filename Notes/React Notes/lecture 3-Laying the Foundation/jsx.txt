what does npx parcel index.html means?

    napx means we are executing npm package parcel and giving source file as index .html

what is sript and why it is needed?

    we can give a name to the command in script and which is present in package.json that name it will be called name of script 
    script{
        "start":"parcel index.html"   (for development)
        "build or anything" : "parcel build index.html"   (for productuin build)
    }
    now we do not need to write 'npx parcel index.html' we can just write 'npm run start' \/ 'npm run build'

**in React we use react.createElement()and we have to pass 3 parametre in it
  (tag(h1,p),Object{},Html you want  to write in it"Hello this is html") 
  it is a core thing to create element in React it comes from react library

  react element at the end of the day is object and when we render it on to the dom then it become html elemelt




                                             JSX
                            JJJJJJJJJJJSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSXXXXXXXXXXXX
                                              J
                                              S

                                    Javascript Syntax

**JSX is an HTML like Syntax Which can be written in Javascript file itself

jsx is also developed by Facebook developer because the core react has a very compicated type of writing structure
so jsx help developer to write code in html like struture in js file


jsx is type of convention in which we can merge html and js in js file

EX----creating heading using JSX in js file
        const JsxHeading = <h1>The theading is created using jsx </h1>

**javascript is a code which js engine can understand

**can js engine understand jsx?

    no js engine cant understand jsx it can understand only ecmaScript(es6)

 "const JsxHeading = <h1>The theading is created using jsx </h1>"
 our browser cant understand this peace of code

 so,when we write our code then the code is transpiled bybable a package present in parcel before it to js engine 
 and then js engine recieves the code that js engine can understand

[Before JSX]
React.createElement ==> React Element (which is at the end is an object) ==> html Element (when renderd)

[After JSX]
JSX ==>Bable transpiles it to React.createElement ==> React Element(an object) ==> html Element (when renderd)

**In html we use class as attribute and in jsx we use classname as attribute
**if we are writting jsx in multiple lines  we need to use () otherwisewe can write normaly if we are writing in single line
const JsxHeading = (<h1>
        The theading is created using jsx
    </h1>)
    we use this brackets so that bable can understand where from jsx is starting and till where it is 


what is bable and what it is doing ?
   bable is a javascript compile or transpiler which transpile the code which js engine understand

where it is present?
 it is a package present in Parcel
 and it is not created by Facebook


jsx is that good that it take care of melcious data should not come in your browser
